# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction Project

This project focuses on end-to-end customer churn analysis using SQL, Power BI, and Python's Random Forest classification model. The key steps include:

✅Explored, cleaned, and transformed churn-related data using SQL, handling missing values and anomalies for modeling.

✅Visualizes Key Insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard showing KPIs, churn breakdowns, and customer behavior.

✅Builds a Churn Prediction Model using Python’s Random Forest algorithm to predict if a customer will churn or stay.

✅Deploys the Model on New Data to automatically classify future customers into "Churned" or "Stayed" categories.
